![photo](figures/foto.jpg) My name is Francisco Fonseca. I currently lead a team of data scientists in Brazil. I love to learn new things related to statistics, machine learning, i.e., data science in general. My current technical subjects of interest are statistical thinking of data science and probabilistic programming.

My academic experience consists of a Computer Science BSc degree at UFV (Federal University of Vi√ßosa - Brazil/MG) in 2002, a Computer Science MSc degree at PUC-Rio (Pontifical Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil/RJ) in Computer Graphics in 2004.
